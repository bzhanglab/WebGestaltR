#' Site Weighted Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
#'
#' Performs site weighted gene set enrichment analysis or standard GSEA when
#' likelihood/weight columns in \code{input_df} are 1 or 0, \code{p=1},
#' \code{q=1} and \code{thresh_type="val"}.
#'
#' The formula for weighting is as follows
#' \deqn{\frac{s_{j}^{q}|r_{j}|^{p}}{\sum s^{q}|r|^{p}}}{(s_j^q * abs(r_j)^p) / (\sum s^q * abs(r)^p)}
#' Where r is log ratio score, s is likelihood score, j is the index of the gene.
#'
#' @param input_df A data frame in which first column is name of item of interest
#' (gene, protein, phosphosite, etc.), the second is the correlation of that item
#' of interest with the phenotype (typically log ratio of expression for phenotype
#' vs. normal), and the remaining columns are the scores for the likelihood that
#' the item belongs in each set (one column per set).
#' @param thresh_type The type of \code{thresh}. Use 'percentile' to include all
#' scores over that percentile given in \code{thresh} (i.e., 0.9 would be all items
#' in 90th percentile, or top 10 percent); 'list' to include a list of set lists
#' where the set lists are in the same order as the corresponding set columns in
#' the \code{input_df}; 'val' to apply a single threshold value to all sets; or
#' 'values' to use a vector of unique cutoffs for each set (needs to be in the
#' same order as the sets are specified in the columns of \code{input_df}")
#' @param thresh Depends on \code{thresh_type}. A list of lists of the items in
#' each set (with same names as colnames of the scores); a numeric vector of
#' threshold scores for each set (in the same order as the colnames of the scores
#' in the input_df), or a single percentile value between 0 and 1 (i.e., if
#' \code{thresh}=0.9, the 90th percentile of the score or the highest scoring 10%
#' of of the items are included in the set for each scoring regimen) (\code{thresh}
#' ="all" is not supported at this time, as it doesn't result in a Kolgorov-Smirnoff
#' statistic; this may be worked in as an alternate scoring method later on).
#' @param thresh_action Either "include", "exclude (default)", or "adjust";
#' this specifies how to treat each set if it doesn't contain a minimum number of
#' items or contains all of the items; this option cannot be used with predefined
#' lists of items in sets (if the number of items in a given set doesn't meet
#' requirements, that set will be skipped).
#' @param min_set_size,max_set_size The minimum/maximum number of items each
#' set needs for the analysis to proceed.
#' @param max_score,min_score A optional numeric vector of minimum/maximum boundaries
#' to clip scores for each set.
#' @param psuedocount Psuedocount (pc) is used for rescaling set scores:
#' \code{(score - min_score + pc)/(max_score - min_score +pc)}; this is needed to
#' prevent division by 0 if \code{max_score==min_score} (in this case, all scores
#' for items in set will be 1, which is equivalent to standard GSEA); it also allows
#' users to adjust weights for scores that are close to the minimum for the scores in
#' the set (unless min_score==max_score): as psuedocount value approaches 0, scaled
#' minimum scores also approach 0; as psuedocount approaches infinity, scaled minimum
#' scores approach the scaled maximum scores (which equal 1); this value must be
#' larger than 0.
#' @param perms The number of permutations.
#' @param p The exponential scaling factor of the phenotype score (second column in
#' \code{input_df}).
#' @param q The exponential scaling factor of the likelihood score (weights).
#' @param nThreads The number of threads to use in calculating permutaions.
#' @param rng_seed Random seed.
#' @param fork A boolean. Whether pass "fork" to \code{type} parameter of
#' \code{makeCluster} on Unix-like machines.
#'
#' @return A list of \code{Enrichment_Results}, \code{Items_in_Set} and \code{Running_Sums}.
